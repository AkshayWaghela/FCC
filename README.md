## 🤖 Rock-Paper-Scissors AI Strategy Explorer

An AI-powered simulator that evaluates different strategies for playing Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS). The highlight is a **Markov Chain-based AI** capable of predicting opponent moves and achieving a consistent win rate of over 60%.

**📌 Key Features:**

* Simulates and compares 6 bot strategies, including a custom Markov Chain AI.
* Visualizes win rates, move distributions, and streaks using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
* Interactive dashboard using `ipywidgets` for head-to-head bot analysis.

**🚀 Technologies:** Python, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ipywidgets

**📊 Sample Output:**

## 🏥 Health Insurance Cost Prediction

A regression project that predicts individual medical expenses based on personal attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.

**🔍 Workflow:**

* Preprocesses data with one-hot encoding and log transformation.
* Trains a feedforward neural network with dropout and batch normalization.
* Evaluates performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

**🎯 Goal:** Achieve MAE < 3500 on original expense scale.

**📉 Visuals:**

* Scatter plot of predicted vs. true expenses.
* Histogram of expense predictions.

**📦 Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, pandas, Scikit-learn
